This is a repository that holds 22 projects of mine that I worked on in order to help solidify my core knowledge of machine learning.

These projects are labeled A1-A22 and have the following names:

Many of these projects were challenges to myself to create machine learning algorithms "from scratch" or using no machine learning packages/libraries.
I allowed myself to use certain libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib so I could focus on the ML concepts.
