This is a repository that holds 22 projects of mine that I worked on in order to help solidify my core knowledge of machine learning.

These projects are labeled A1-A22 and have the following names:

A1:

A3:
A4:
A5:
A6: PCA from scratch: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors (Python)
A7:
A8:
A9:
A10: Dimesionality Reduction in Cancer Diagnosis (R)
A11: Dimesnionality Reduction ISLR (R)
A12: Decision Trees (R)
A13:
A14:
A15:
A16:
A17:
A18:
A19:
A20:
A21
A22:

Many of these projects were challenges to myself to create machine learning algorithms "from scratch" or using no machine learning packages/libraries.
I allowed myself to use certain libraries like numpy, pandas and matplotlib so I could focus on the ML concepts. Other projects used ML packages, but were taken from the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" ISL. These projects were done using R.
